FPS (Frames Per Second) is calculated by measuring the time it takes to capture or display a certain number of frames and then computing the rate at which frames are processed or displayed per second. Hereâ€™s a general approach to calculating FPS:

Basic Calculation:
Capture or Display Time:

Determine the time it takes to capture or display a single frame. This is often measured in seconds.
Calculate FPS:

The FPS can be calculated using the reciprocal of the time taken to process one frame. If time_per_frame is the time taken for one frame in seconds, then:
\text{FPS} = \frac{1}{\text{time_per_frame}}
